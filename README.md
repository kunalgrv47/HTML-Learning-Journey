# HTML Learning Journey

Welcome to my HTML learning journey repository! ðŸš€

## Introduction

This repository serves as a documentation of my journey as I learn and practice HTML. I'm excited to share my progress, projects, and resources with you.

## Folder Structure

This repository is organized into two main folders:

1. **Learning Materials**: This folder contains my notes, code snippets, and resources related to HTML learning.

2. **Learning Projects**: Here, you'll find the hands-on projects I've created to apply what I've learned.

Feel free to explore these folders to follow along with my learning journey.

## Learning Path

I plan to cover the following topics in my HTML learning journey:

- Basic HTML structure
- HTML elements and attributes
- Creating forms
- Styling with CSS
- JavaScript integration (optional)
- Responsive design (optional)

## Projects

I'll work on various HTML projects to apply what I've learned. You can find these projects in the "Learning Projects" folder.

- [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) HTML Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

Feel free to suggest more resources if you have any!

## Goals

- Improve my HTML coding skills.
