# HTML Learning Journey

Welcome to my HTML learning journey repository! ðŸš€

## Introduction

This repository serves as a documentation of my journey as I learn and practice HTML. I'm excited to share my progress, projects, and resources with you.

## Tools Used

During my HTML learning journey, I'm using the following tools and software:

- **Code Editor**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Visual Studio Code is my preferred code editor for writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers a wide range of extensions and features to enhance the development experience.

- **Web Browser**:
  - [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/): I primarily use Google Chrome for testing and previewing my web pages. It comes with developer tools that are handy for debugging.
  - [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge): I also use Microsoft Edge for cross-browser testing to ensure compatibility with different browsers.

- **Version Control**: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/)
  - Git is the version control system I use to track changes in my code, and GitHub is where I host this repository to share my learning journey with others.

Feel free to ask me about any specific tools or software I'm using during my journey!
